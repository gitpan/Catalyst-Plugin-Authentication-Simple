Catalyst-Plugin-Authentication-Simple version 1.0
=================================================

A 'simple' authentication mechanism for Catalyst.
Usernames, passwords, & roles come from either a file
or an array ref.

In your Catalyst main module say something like:

MyCatalystObject->config(   
        ....
        authentication => {
            user_file => '/full/path/to/user/file',
            [ password_hash => 'md5' OR 'sha' ]
        },


The format of 'user_file' is:

<user1>:<pass1>:<role1>,<role2>,<role3>
<user2>:<pass2>:<role2>,<role4>
<user3>:<pass3>:<role1>,<role3>,<role4>
...

Instead of 'user_file' you can pass in an array ref like:
            
        authentication => {
            users => [
                        '<user1>:<pass1>:<role1>,<role2>,<role3>',
                        '<user2>:<pass2>:<role2>,<role4>',
                        '<user3>:<pass3>:<role1>,<role3>,<role4>.
                    ],
            [ password_hash => 'md5' OR 'sha' ]
            

IF 'password_hash' is set to md5 or sha the password is a hash of one of those
two variants, so the $password you pass into 'login' or 'session_login' will be
hashed by Digest::MD5::md5_hex or Digest::SHA::sha1_hex & then checked for equality.

Final thing - if you pass in a filename the username list will be read in once & only once & then 
converted to the 'users' array ref.  Later in your app you can dynamically change this
array ref. as you please for future login attempts...

Have Fun!
